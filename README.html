<h2>Changelog</h2>

<p>2015-02-03</p>

<ul>
<li>things that were in bower_components are now in /lib - please note, that hidden file .bowerrc is required for that to work (you might miss it if you just download/expand ZIP)</li>
<li>if any included components are referenced from scss or php - these point to something in /lib now</li>
<li>/lib/foundation-base-lib is separate GIT submodule now (no need to worry, unless you plan to contribute)</li>
<li>all php files are required from functions.php (previously some were included from foundation-base.php)</li>
<li>this means, that if you change some part in /lib - move it to your foundation-base folder first and change require</li>
<li>codekit project now defaults to compiling with libsass (faaaaaaaast) + creating map file for scss (and css is compressed by default)</li>
<li>config.codekit.template includes these changes, overwrite your config.codekit with that</li>
<li>@print styles, include at the very end of styles.scss</li>
<li>editor styles</li>
</ul>


<p>Updating foundation and foundation-base-lib is simple: go to the childtheme base folder and type:
<code>bower update</code></p>

<p>This updates both foundation and foundation-base-lib (and creates some additional components in /lib &hellip; that should not be needed in web, so you can safely remove everything, except foundation and foundation-base-lib, of course)</p>

<p>What are needed changes in existing projects, should you decide to bring them up to today&rsquo;s changes?</p>

<ul>
<li>download a copy of new foundation-base</li>
<li>take requires from the start of functions.php, use in your current functions.php</li>
<li>same for items at the beginning of style.scss and _settings.scss - foundation and thematic rows are important</li>
<li>copy hidden .bowwerrc, not-hidden bower.json, codekit.config</li>
<li>delete current /bower_components and /library (unless you have made local changes there), from scss _thematic.scss (that is now in lib)</li>
<li>do <code>bower update</code> to have new /lib created</li>
</ul>


<p>sorry for the mess, I hope that next upates will be way easier :-)</p>

<p>2015-02-02</p>

<ul>
<li>move all bower-updatable foundation-base components to foundation-base-lib</li>
<li>introduce .bowerrc, use /lib instead of bower_components</li>
<li>start gitignoring foundation components that are not needed during runtime (as everything needed is in vendor anyway)</li>
<li>default scss processing to libsass, compressed, with sourcemaps</li>
</ul>


<p>2015-02-02</p>

<ul>
<li>remove umlauts + cyrillic from filenames, also lowercase all filenames on upload</li>
<li>possibility to switch off using Google jQuery (new constant, not mandatory)</li>
<li>possibility to tell which version of jQuery to use from Google (new constants, not mandatory)</li>
<li>&ldquo;dummy&rdquo; jquery registered for IE8 case - to avoid problems with plugins dependent on jquery (as IE8 fix adds jQuery not through official means but IE conditional in footer)</li>
<li>all php files have now if ( ! defined( &lsquo;ABSPATH&rsquo; ) ) exit; at the beginning to avoid direct execution attempts</li>
<li>Foundation &amp; dependencies upgrade to 5.5.1</li>
</ul>
